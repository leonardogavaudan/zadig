# Zadig - A platform on which you can vizualize your eating habits

The main dataset we are using for this project is: https://www.kaggle.com/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions

We are going to implement an application that:

- Retrieves all of your past eating recipes
- Analyze what nutriments compose most of the food you consume
- Compare that analysis with the recommended daily intake provided by the NHS: https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/what-are-reference-intakes-on-food-labels/
- Provide data vizualizations explaining where you lack the most nutriments
- Explain how that might impact your health
- Create a recommendation system that provides dishes that take into account what you need most and/or your personal preferences
- We are using 7 different nutrional measures in order to assess one's habits

Nutrition information:

- calories (#)
- total fat (PDV),
- sugar (PDV)
- sodium (PDV)
- protein (PDV)
- saturated fat (PDV)
- carbohydrates (PDV))
